        "program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Keywords are used to define the syntax of the coding. The keyword cannot be used as an identifier, function, or variable name. All the keywords in Python are written in lowercase except True and False.Python has many predifined functions some of them are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.def: This keyword is like a label for creating functions. Functions are small sections of code that perform specific tasks. In our example, register and login are functions that handle user registration and login.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.if and else: These words help the program make decisions. For example, if we want to check if a username is already taken, we use if. If it’s not taken, we use else to tell the program what to do next.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.return: This keyword is like a way for functions to send back results. After doing their job, functions can use return to give information back to the part of the program that called them, like saying whether registration or login was successful.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.import: This keyword allows us to bring in additional tools or libraries from Python’s collection. It’s not used in our simple example, but it’s very helpful when you need extra features, like encrypting passwords.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.__name__ and __main__: These are special names used to check how the script is being run. If you run the script directly, the code inside if __name__ == \"__main__\": will run. If the script is being imported into another script, that part won’t run. It helps keep things organized.\n",

        "3.Compare and contrast mutable and immutable objects in Python with examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. There are two types of objects in Python i.e. Mutable and Immutable objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.Mutable Objects: Mutable Objects are of type Python list, Python dict, or Python set. Custom classes are generally mutable. Aer used when you need to modify, add, or remove existing data frequently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:If we take a Python List object and try to modify its value using the index. A list in Python is mutable, that is, it allows us to change its value once it is created:\n",
        "\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "my_list.append(4)\n",

        "2.Immutable Objects: Immutable Objects are of in-built datatypes like int, float, bool, string, Unicode, and tuple. In simple words, an immutable object can’t be changed after it is created. Are used When you want to ensure data remains consistent and unaltered.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: iF we take a tuple and try to modify its value at a particular index and print it. As a tuple is an immutable object, it will throw an error when we try to modify it:\n",

        "tuple1 = (0, 1, 2, 3)\n",
